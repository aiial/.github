The [Peter Moss MedTech Research Project](https://www.leukemiaairesearch.com/research/project/peter-moss-medtech-research-project) is an [Asociaci√≥n de Investigacion en Inteligencia Artificial Para la Leucemia Peter Moss](https://www.leukemiaairesearch.com/) research project dedicated to researching into the latest modern technologies and how they can be used to enhance the medical industry. Our mission is to reduce the cost of medical care through automation and implementation of the latest technologies including Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, the Internet of Things, the Blockchain, Virtual/Augmented & Mixed Reality.

We are creating an open source movement for medical technology research. No patents, no proprietary data, no proprietary code. We want to change how the medical system works, and provide our research and technology open and free.
