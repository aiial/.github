[Peter Moss Leukaemia MedTech Research](https://www.leukaemiamedtechresearch.org.uk/research/project/peter-moss-medtech-research-project) is a non-profit based in the UK that was created in memory of Peter Edward Moss who died from Acute Myeloid Leukaemia in 2019 after a year long fight with the disease. We are a group of technology enthusiasts and medical professionals brought together by the common interest in battling leukaemia and improving the healthcare/medical industries with open-source technologies, and sharing open information about Leukaemia for patients, families and carers. We aim to use our knowledge and skills to create a better world for Leukaemia patients and their families.

We bring together individuals, companies and organizations to create innovative technologies that could be used in the fight against leukaemia. We are building a network of innovation and collaboration to provide a better future for people and society. We are creating an open source movement for medical technology research. No patents, no proprietary data, no proprietary code. We want to change how the medical system works, and provide our research and technology open and free.
